A log of my work history on this project.

**Timeline**:
- *Week 1*:
  - Learned the meanshift and camshift algorithms in OpenCV.
  - Learned how to input and read video in OpenCV.
  - Followed tutorials that demonstrated feature tracking in videos.
  - Ran into linker errors that did not allow the project to be built.
- *Week 2*:
  - Struggled to fix linker errors.
  - Continued to research OpenCV methods while on Thanksgiving break.
  - Looked into more precise feature tracking techniques.
  - Unable to test any code due to linker errors preventing build.
- *Week 3*:
  - Went to Office Hours the first day back from break, worked with the TA for 30 mins to 45 mins trying to resolve errors.
  - Came to the conclusion that there were known issues with the included OFxOpenCV addon that I was trying to use.
  - TA advised me to try and use a different external OpenCV implementation.
  - Attempted to use the recommended OpenCV library; did not see any improved results.
  - Decided to switch away from using OpenCV; began brainstorming new project ideas.
- *Week 4*:
  - Came up with new basketball game project proposal.
  - Successfully installed and began working with box2d.
  - Began fiddling with creating a game environment as well as developing models for the ball and hoop.
  - Successfully implemented a progressive shooting mechanic as well as a reloading mechanic.
  - Successfully implemented a solid model for the hoop.
  - Successfully implemented the score mechanics as well as a level-up mechanic.
  - Successfully implemented 3 levels of varying difficulty.
  - Successfully implemented a progress bar to represent the power-up on a shot.
  - Successfully updated the styling of the basket.
  - Successfully implemented a high-score mechanic to keep track of the current high-score in the session.
  - Successfully implemented unit testing to test all non Box2D or OpenFrameworks related functions.
  - Successfully completed a full in-depth ReadMe file.
