### Project Proposal

Due to unforseen issues with the OFxOpenCV library and countless hours of struggling with resulting linker errors, I have 
decided to switch my project from the original proposal to a new project that involves creating a basketball game.

I am interested in working on this project because I have played and watched basketball since I was young. I really enjoyed playing
simplistic basketball games and always wanted to create one of my own. This game is going to be a really simple 2D game with 
just a basketball and a hoop. Players will control the power of each shot and will attempt to make as many shots as possible 
in a row, with the game getting progressively harder as the player's score increases.

To accomplish this task, I primarily will be using the OpenFrameworks library [box2d](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d/).

**Rough Timeline**:
- *Week 1*: Fully set up box2d and learn how to create and manipulate objects and environments.
- *Week 2*: Build out the structure of the game, including the ball and hoop classes as well as the set up of the game environment.
- *Week 3*: Set up the shot-taking functionality, work on detecting whether or not a shot passes through the hoop and how to 
            reset the ball after each shot.
- *Week 4*: Develop the different stages of the game, making the game harder as the player continues to make consecutive shots.
        
**Stretch Goals**: 
- Look into incoporating image overlays as graphics to make the game look more realistic.
- Develop more advanced levels.
- Develop more advanced shooting mechanics/ball features.
